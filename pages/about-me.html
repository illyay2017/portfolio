          <h3>My long, zig-zagged journey into tech</h3>
          <p>I immigrated to the Unites States from Ukraine with my parents when I was 12 years old.
            Living in New York City, I attended Murray Bergtraum High School for Business Careers,
            where I majored in Computer Science. This was my first exposure to coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating High School, I landed an internship at JPMorgan Investment Bank,
            and spent the next number of years working in Finance (at JPMorgan and a small hedge fund),
            while attending university and studying Economics and Pre-medicine. Things looked promising.
            A few years later, though, things took a turn for the worse. As personal life got in the way,
            I lost interest in my work in Finance. I was laid off, along with hundreds of thousands of
            others amidst the subprime cricis. I dropped out of university, uninspired by my career
            trajectory and, at that point - by life in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of necessity, of course, I had to find a job. Finding new work in finance, besides being
            something I didn't want at the time, proved to be nearly impossible anyway. People with years
            of experience suddenly found themselves competing for entry-level jobs as the layoffs continued
            and openings dwindled. I stood no chance against them, especially since I dropped out. So my mother
            suggested I apply for a job at her workplace: The Plaza hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the next 7 years working there, first as a Guest Reception Agent, and then a Concierge
            for nearly 5 years. There, I learned how to be a better communicator, how to deal with high-stress
            situations, and most importantly - made some incredible friends. The concierge team was like my second
            family. My hotelier friends, one of whom was a very special one named Lauren, helped me come out of my
            mini depression: to see there was joy to be had in life, something to look forward to, something to
            aspire to.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to go back to university and finish my degree in Economics, but I immediately knew
            I wanted to shift my career focus to technology. This was where all the intersting stuff was happening.
            I did just that: while working full time as concierge, I went back to school. I enrolled in basic
            Computer Science fundamentals courses, where my high school experience helped me excel.
            I maintained a 4.0 for the 2 years it took me to finish my degree, and finally graduated in 2017. I was
            a new college grad, but with 5 years of experience in Finance and 7 years in Luxury Hospitality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later that year, Lauren and I got married. We quit out jobs, decided to take a 6-month honeymoon,
            travel across Europe and regroup to start a new chapter in a new city: San Francisco. This is where I
            ended up attending the coding boot camp Hack Reactor, which really helped me take a deep dive into
            Software Engineering and system design. Since then, I have worked as a Full Stack Engineer, a Support
            Engineer, and a Technical Project Manager / Solutions Architect.
          </p>
          <p>
            With asiprations of building my own technology company one day, I have created this site to continue
            to practice coding, and to serve as a portfolio of my projects for potential future employers. Because my
            journey into tech has been rather non-traditional, I hope sharing this story goes a long way to convince
            them to give me a shot.
